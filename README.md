# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, and the game ends when one player wins or when the board is full, resulting in a tie.

## Files

- `tictactoe.py`: The main Python script that runs the Tic Tac Toe game.
- `helpers.py`: Contains helper functions for drawing the game board and checking the turn.

## How to Play

1. Run `tictactoe.py` using a Python interpreter.
2. Players take turns entering a number (1-9) to mark a spot on the board.
3. The game ends when one player wins, or the board is full, resulting in a tie.
4. To quit the game, press 'q' during your turn.

## Features

- Player turn tracking.
- Game board drawn in the console.
